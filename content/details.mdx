### Scale to zero

When a Neon compute endpoint hasn't received any connections for a specified amount of time, it can [autosuspend](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/auto-suspend).
This is useful for:

-  **Resource Management** - Turning off unused databases is automatic.
- **Cost-Efficiency** - Never pay for compute that's not serving queries.

But scale to zero is only useful if compute can start up quickly again when it's needed. That's why cold start times are so important.

### Applications of scale to zero

Look at the cold start times documented above and decide: _In what scenarios is the occasional <SingleStat stat="p50" /> of additional latency acceptable?_

The answer depends on the specifics of your project.
Here are some example scenarios where scale to zero may be useful:

- **Non-Production Databases** - Development, preview, staging, test databases.
- **Internal Apps** - If the userbase for your app is a limited number of employees, the db is likely idle more than active.
- **Database-per-user Architectures** - Instead of having a single database for all users, if you have a separate database for each user, the activity level of any one database may be low enough that scale to zero results in significant cost reduction.
- **Small Projects** - For small projects, configuring the production database to scale to zero can make it more cost-efficient without major impact to UX.

# Benchmark methodology

To gather real-world cold start times, the benchmark uses a Neon project with a separate [database branch](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/branching) for each of the above variants. A [node.js script](https://github.com/joacoc/neon-query-benchmarks/blob/main/setup/index.js) executes the following steps for every branch every 30 minutes:

1. Check that the database branch is autosuspended
1. Connect to the branch, forcing it to start. - The connect time (see below) is subtracted from this time to establish the [Cold Start](#cold-starts) time.*
1. Run ten queries on the active database. - The results are recorded as the **[Query](#queries)** time.
1. Connect and disconnect ten times to measure connect times - The results are recorded as the **[Connect](#connections)** time.
3. Log all the timings to the main database.
4. Suspend the database branch.

\* **Why subtract connect from cold start?** - From the client, the only way to establish a cold start time is to connect to the database while it is suspended. 

### Calculating Results

The cold start duration for every benchmark run is saved in a table.
To calculate the results, results are fetched and the [`simple-statistics`](https://simple-statistics.github.io/) library is used to calculate P50, P99, and Standard Deviation of results.

The code where the results are calculated can be found [here](https://github.com/joacoc/neon-query-benchmarks/blob/main/hooks/index.tsx#L126-L134).

### Benchmark Code

All code for the benchmark and display of results is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/joacoc/neon-query-benchmarks/blob/main/setup/index.js) Here is a snippet showing how the timing of the cold start is measured:

**Cold Start Timing:**
```javascript
// Cold Start + Connect (where the database starts out suspended)
const coldTimeStart = Date.now(); // <-- Start timer
await benchClient.connect(); // <-- Connect
let coldConnectMs = Date.now() - coldTimeStart; // <-- Stop timer
```

**Connect Timing:**
```javascript
const hotConnectTimes = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  const benchClient = new DRIVERS[driver](connection_details);
  const start = Date.now(); // <-- Start timer
  await benchClient.connect(); // <-- Connect
  hotConnectTimes.push(Date.now() - start); // <-- Stop timer
  await benchClient.query(benchmarkQuery); // <-- Query
  await benchClient.end();
}
```

**Query Timing:**
```javascript
await benchClient.connect(); // <-- Connect
...
const hotQueryTimes = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  const start = Date.now(); // <-- Start timer
  await benchClient.query(benchmarkQuery); // <-- Query
  hotQueryTimes.push(Date.now() - start); // <-- Stop timer
}
```

# Try It Yourself

Sign up for the [free Neon account](https://neon.tech), clone the repo for this benchmark and website: [Neon Cold Start Repo](https://github.com/joacoc/neon-query-benchmarks) and you can run and modify the benchmarks yourself.
Follow the developer docs in the repo to get started.

Keep in mind that benchmarks run locally will include the roundtrip latency from your device to AWS datacenter. The cold starts from this page are deployed in a Lambda in the same AWS region as the Neon database.
