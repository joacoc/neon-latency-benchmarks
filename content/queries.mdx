# Queries

Once a connection between client and host is established, queries are a straightforward request/response process.

```javascript
import pg from "pg";
const { Client } = pg;
const client = new Client();
await client.connect();
const res = await client.query("SELECT * from table where id=1"); // [!code focus]
console.log(res.rows[0]);
await client.end();
```

Query latency depends on two factors:

1. **Client\<\>Database proximity** - The network latency
1. **Query Complexity** - A complex SQL query requires more work from the database before responding.
