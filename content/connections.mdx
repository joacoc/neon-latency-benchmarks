# Connections

Before querying a Postgres database, a connection must be established.

```javascript
import pg from "pg";
const { Client } = pg;
const client = new Client("...");
await client.connect();  // [!code focus]
const res = await client.query("SELECT * from table where id=1");
console.log(res.rows);
await client.end();
```

When a connection is initiated _(via `client.connect()` in the Node.JS example above)_, several steps and network roundtrips must happen before the connection is ready:

1. **DNS lookup**
2. **TCP connection**
3. **TLS Negotiation**
4. **Postgres Auth and Connection**

Each of these steps involves at least one trip between client and host. That makes **Client\<\>Database proximity** the primary factor in time required to establish a connection.

This benchmark runs the client in the same AWS region as the Neon Project in order to reduce connection latency.

### Connections via Serverless Driver

Neon has a [serverless driver](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) that extends the standard node-postgres driver `pg` to work over HTTP and WebSockets instead of TCP.
Establishing a connection via the serverless driver is often faster because of [optimizations that reduce the roundtrips required](https://neon.tech/blog/quicker-serverless-postgres).

Data from this benchmarks shows the following difference in connection times between the two drivers:
